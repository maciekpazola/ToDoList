# Project description

The To-Do List project is a web application developed in Angular using TypeScript. It allows users to manage a list of tasks across multiple lists. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, and move tasks between lists. The application is responsive, has an intuitive user interface, and persists data in the browser's local storage to maintain the state between sessions.

# Features

Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to specific lists by entering a task title.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list.
Change state of tasks
Persist Application State: The application state (task lists) is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing the task list to persist between user sessions.

# Webapps

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
